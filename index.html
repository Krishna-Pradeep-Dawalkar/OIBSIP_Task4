    <p style="font-size:2vw;">Elon Reeve Musk is an entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief
        Engineer at SpaceX; early-stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring
        Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="background-color:blue; color:white;">He is one of the people that constantly shape the 21st century</p>
    <p>Today, Elon Musk stands as an emblem of a revolutionary inventor. We think of him as a man who is successful at
        everything he does. But his reflection on his personal life illustrates that life has not always been easy for
        him; as a child, he was bullied at school and abused at home, and he experienced a great deal of pain. However,
        Musk credits his early traumatic experiences with a great portion of his success. Without adversity, he believes
        that he might not have been so motivated to succeed. But his pain is not the only driving factor in his success;
        Elon Musk is also someone of incredible passion and intellect and he is relentlessly committed to pursuing his
        goal: improving the world through technology.</p>

        <h2><b>THE EARLY YEARS</b></h2>
        <p id="para"></p>The introduction to this book neatly summarizes most of what the average person knows about
        Elon Musk. He is a
        notable public figure because of his contributions to science and technology; in the age of Instagram, this —
        along
        with his marriage to singer Grimes — has earned him something of a celebrity status. But how much do we really
        know
        about the man behind these accomplishments? In this chapter, we’ll take a look at Elon Musk’s childhood and
        learn
        about the experiences that made him the man he is today. Although Musk is now one of America’s most notable
        billionaires, he didn’t start out that way. Elon Musk was born in 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa. And although
        conspiracy theories have circulated, suggesting that his father — Errol Musk — owned an emerald mine and
        inherited
        apartheid money, Musk has solidly refuted these stories.

        <h2><b>MUSK’S EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES AND EARLY CAREER</b></h2>
        <p id="para"></p>In South Africa at that time, young men faced mandatory conscription into the military when
        they reached the age
        of
        17. Musk already knew that military service wasn’t for him, so he emigrated to Canada. Because his mother was a
        Canadian national, her heritage would enable him to later obtain citizenship. He wanted to move to the US, but
        at
        the time of his emigration to Canada, he could barely afford so much as a sandwich. He definitely couldn’t
        afford to
        make an even bigger international move and start a new life for himself with no money.
        </p>
        <h2><b>MUSK’S CAREER BEGINS TO TAKE OFF</b></h2>
        <p id="para"></p>Following his graduation, Musk immediately decided to take his career to the next level and
        move to California.
        Silicon Valley was a hub of technological genius and he was a young tech whiz looking to make his next move; it
        seemed like a match made in heaven! So, Elon, Justine, and their family moved to California. It was then that
        hiscareer began to take off. His early experiences in Silicon Valley made him an overnight dotcom millionaire,
        thanks to the success of his startup, Zip2. Shortly thereafter, he launched another company with co-founder
        Peter
        Thiel, and what started out as X.com would later become PayPal, the service loved and used around the world
        today!
        Some people might have been content to quit after becoming a millionaire in their mid-twenties. But Elon Musk
        was
        just getting started. And that’s when he dove headfirst into the space industry. At that time, the Mars Society
        was
        conducting an experiment in which they sent sexually active mice into orbit. This experiment was conducted with
        the
        intention of hopefully being the first organization to put life on Mars. Established in 1998, the Mars Society
        is
        the world’s largest and most influential space advocacy organization dedicated to the human exploration and
        settlement of the planet Mars. Musk was fascinated by the Mars Society and their mission and he wanted to get
        involved. He liked the idea of a short-cut that scrapped the plan to send mice into space; he wanted to send
        them
        straight to Mars instead and see what happened.
        But once again, he wasn’t content to stop there, and that’s when he created Tesla. Tesla is a revolutionary
        electric
        car company. That’s right — electric cars are kind of his whole thing now. So, it’s no surprise that Elon Musk
        and
        Tesla are the United States’ poster children for sustainable automotives. Having received start-up money from
        the
        United States government, Tesla’s first electric car did very well indeed. It was marketed primarily towards
        America’s super-rich and its success fueled Musk’s future projects. Building on the success of his first,
        exclusive
        design, Musk set out to design something that would be more commercially available: the Model S. The Model S is
        a
        luxury sedan that was designed with one purpose in mind: to be faster, cooler, smarter, and sleeker than any
        traditional vehicle on the market. Musk knew that if he could make electric cars look cooler than the options,
        people would be more likely to buy them, even if those customers weren’t especially interested in the
        environment.
        And he was right! With theability to accelerate in one second and a battery life that allows it to run 300
        miles,
        the Model S is every car fanatic’s dream. It also enabled Musk to dominate the current electric car market. His
        success also occurred at the perfect time. Because just as the Model S took off, Japan’s electric vehicle market
        took a massive hit, allowing Musk to seize control of the international electric vehicle market.
